                    My name is Ezgi , and I am a dedicated Reiki Master and
                    healer. My journey into the world of energy healing began not
                    with a sudden awakening, but with a quiet whisper a persistent
                    inner calling to seek deeper understanding, connection, and
                    healing. Healing is not just my profession it's my calling, my
                    passion, and a legacy that runs deep within my bloodline.{" "}
                    <br />
                    <br /> 
                    I come from a lineage of healers. My great-grandmother
                    was known in her community as a gifted healer. She worked with
                    herbs, energy, intuition, and the natural world to bring
                    balance and relief to those around her.Though I never met her,
                    her wisdom, spirit, and strength have been passed down through
                    generations, and I often feel her presence guiding me in my
                    practice. This ancestral connection grounds my work in
                    tradition, love, and a deep respect for those who came before
                    me.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Though the path wasn't always clear, I felt a pull toward
                    healing from a young age deeply empathetic, sensitive to
                    others' emotions, and drawn to the unseen energies that shape
                    our lives. It wasn't until I faced my own health crisis and
                    emotional challenges, when conventional methods offered
                    limited relief, that I truly embraced the power of alternative
                    healing and that's when Reiki found me."
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I was introduced to Reiki through a trusted friend, and my
                    first session was life-changing bringing a profound sense of
                    peace, clarity, and emotional release unlike anything I had
                    ever experienced. Inspired by that transformation, That moment
                    ignited a fire in me and I knew this was my path. I began my
                    Reiki training with Level I, Level II practitioner and
                    eventually a Reiki Master., becoming attuned and certified
                    through, what began as self-healing expanded into helping
                    others heal too.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My approach is grounded in compassion, presence, and the
                    belief that everyone has the innate ability to heal. I
                    continue to learn and grow, incorporating meditation, breath
                    work, and other holistic practices to support my work. Reiki
                    is intuitive and heart-centred. I hold sacred space for my
                    clients to feel safe, seen, and supported. Each session is
                    guided by the universal life force energy, my own spiritual
                    guidance, and a deep trust in the body and spirit's ability to
                    heal.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Today, I am honoured to carry forward the healing legacy of my
                    ancestors, blending ancient wisdom with modern practice.
                    Whether you're seeking emotional clarity, physical relief, or
                    spiritual realignment, I offer Reiki as a gentle yet powerful
                    tool for transformation. Reiki is not just what I do â€” it is a
                    way of life that continues to open my heart and expand my
                    soul.
